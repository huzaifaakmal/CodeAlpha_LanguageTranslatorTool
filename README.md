# ðŸ’¬ Language Translation Tool

A simple and clean web-based language translation tool built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This tool allows users to translate text between various languages, copy the translation to their clipboard, and listen to the translated text using the browser's built-in speech synthesis.

## How to Use

This is a front-end-only project and does not require a special server or build step.

1.  **Download the files:**
    * `index.html`
    * `style.css`
    * `script.js`
2.  **Place them in the same directory:**
    ```
    /language-translator
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
        â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
    ```
3.  **Open the application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

**Note:** You must have an active internet connection for the translation feature to work, as it needs to contact the MyMemory API.
